# 06_Scaffold

## Learning Objective
The learning objective for this assignment is to give students some exposure and experience with dividing a program into multiple functions that each do their own part. While the 4 functions students need to make have already been provided for them, it should give them an idea of how a larger program can be divided into smaller functions in the future. Students will also have to get each function to work to the specifications provided as well as have to figure out how to arrange the helper functions together.

## Explanation

I removed pretty much everything from all of the functions except the function headers (and from the function headers I removed the return types). Each function is relatively simple so I didn't think any code needed to remain in the functions for the students to figure out how to implement them, plus there are detailed steps before each function on what the function should do. Leaving the function bodies empty also gives students more room to play around with their implementations of the functions and do what works for them. This also may help lead into a future idea that with certain programs and functions, the specific details of implementation are not as important, like with Interfaces.

The class variables were kept to make generating random numbers and getting user input easier as well as providing a bit of a pre-established structure for the program to give students a bit of a guideline, in a sense.

## Possible Additions/Deletions
I might try to differentiate a bit following that mild, medium, spicy model. I consider the scaffolded code in the folder to be the medium model. The mild version may have the return types in the function header and even have some of the original code left in the main function, while the spicy model may have some of the comments for each function removed to get students thinking about what steps would be involved in each function.
