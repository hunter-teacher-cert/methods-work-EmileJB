# Community Building Techniques

### Target Environment: School

School Attributes:
* school size: ~400 (per grade)
* school grade range: 9-12
* faculty count: 3-4
* courses: Intro CS, AP CS Principles, AP CS A, Web Development, Something else advanced that might follow AP CS A, Another something else advanced that might be appropriate for students after Intro CS but not requiring AP CS.

* * *

### Activity|ClassRoutine|Club|Organization|Initiative|System: Beyond the Bulletin

#### How It Works
Beyond the Bulletin is a website (that may or may not be affiliated with the official school website) that displays student's works in their Computer Science classes. There are two important guiding principles that Beyond the Bulletin would follow.

1. Student work will only be uploaded to this site if students opt-in to doing so on a per-project basis
2. The site will only contain student work that was actually assigned as part of the class they're taking

The reasoning behind principle 1 is just that we want to respect student agency, even if they change their mind later. That being said, it wouldn't be wrong to try to convince students to opt-in as long as it's not too pushy and respectful of boundaries.

The reasoning behind principle 2 is that this website is meant to showcase what students are actually doing in their classrooms. The projects displayed would in a sense be a way of advertising the schools computer science departments; the idea being if you're interested you will be get the opportunity to do this if you take the class.  

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
As mentioned in the previous section, I would hope that this would drum up some interest for the Computer Science department. For students not taking CS classes, this might be their first exposure to some of the things you can do after learning CS and might interest them. For students already taking CS classes, they might get interested and/or excited about future projects they know are coming down the line, even if it means continuing along the CS track.

Another positive outcome I hope might come from this is students comparing their work. I know students comparing their work can be iffy at times (which I might also put in the expected hurdles section) but the optimist in me hopes that students will discuss amongst each other their different strategies for completing their work, if for example they see another student added a cool feature that they like to their project.

A tertiary potential positive outcome of this is that this website could also be a good way to share with others outside of the school what the CS program is like, maybe leading to other people or organizations takin an interest to the school.


#### Rollout Timeline
* Since there are a good number of students, who will have a good number of projects, year after year after year, it is important that the website is built to be easily maintained.
* Since this is also meant to be a display of student work, there needs to be a focus on optimizing the UI/UX for navigation and presentation.
* These above two factors means that this website will need to have a lot of forethought put into it.
* Even after it's made, there then needs to be enough student work to actually populate the site.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
People talking about CS classes and projects?

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
A few things that might require some extra planning/detail
* Cheating
* Students feeling bad comparing work
* What to do with archival work (students no longer in the school)
* Student Privacy
* Website Size
* Website Cost?
* How to optimize engagement with this site within school.
* Quantity of student work


#### Completely Alternative/Side Idea similar to this inspired by my Fieldwork: 
Find time during or after school where students can opt in to share and talk about their work in person that other students can attend, almost like a gallery walk.
